# Vapor Visualization

In this repository, you'll find:

1. `VAPOR_Visualization.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to pull variables from a Bifrost simulation, how to calculate a few secondary variables, and how to write that information into a netCDF file that is CF-compliant and readable in Vapor

2. `automate_example.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to write a tailored automation script using pyautogui, which is super helpful when your Vapor commands get super repetitive. Then, the script uses imagio and moviepy to create an animation (both gif & mp4) out of the snapshots taken in Vapor

3. `nco.md`: This is a how-to on post-processing netCDF files after they're written

4. `python_dependencies.md`: This is a list of python packages that are necessary for `automate_example.ipynb`
