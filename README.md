# Vapor Visualization

In this repository, you'll find:

1. A mesh file: This defines the Bifrost simulation mesh, and is needed to gather Bifrost output and write netCDF files
2. A Jupyter notebook: This demonstrates how to pull variables from Bifrost, how to calculate a few secondary variables, and how to write that information into a netCDF file that is CF-compliant and readable in Vapor
